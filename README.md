# Aguiar_et_al_Simulation_model_on_poor_mental_wellbeing_and_youth_obesity

The model was developed in Stella Architect, version 3.3, hence it requires this software to simulate the model. The model has two files: a model file and a data file. The model file has an .stmx extension and the data file has an .isdb extension. To view and simulate the model at no cost, Isee Systems Player software is required. With Isee Player, one can view and run the model. Users can download the software from the following link:
